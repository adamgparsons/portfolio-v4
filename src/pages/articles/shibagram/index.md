# Shibagram

This project started as a way to test my skills I learned during the Ajax + APIs SuperHi course. I wanted to practice querying an api, and rendering the results from the response. When browsing a list of public APIs I found the shibe.online api for Shiba Inu photos. So I created Shibagram, an Instagram alternative for Shiba-Inu lovers. I wanted to go framework-less for this project so I just used good old vanilla Javascipt.
